  abstract = {In the context of observational longitudinal studies, we explored the values of the number of participants and the number of repeated measurements that maximize the power to detect the hypothesized effect, given the total cost of the study. We considered two different models, one that assumes a transient effect of exposure and one that assumes a cumulative effect. Results were derived for a continuous response variable, whose covariance structure was assumed to be damped exponential, and a binary time-varying exposure. Under certain assumptions, we derived simple formulas for the approximate solution to the problem in the particular case in which the response covariance structure is assumed to be compound symmetry. Results showed the importance of the exposure intraclass correlation in determining the optimal combination of the number of participants and the number of repeated measurements, and therefore the optimized power. Thus, incorrectly assuming a time-invariant exposure leads to inefficient designs. We also analyzed the sensitivity of results to dropout, mis-specification of the response correlation structure, allowing a time-varying exposure prevalence and potential confounding impact. We illustrated some of these results in a real study. In addition, we provide software to perform all the calculations required to explore the combination of the number of participants and the number of repeated measurements.

  abstract = {The effect of number of repeated measures on the variance of the generalized least squares (GLS) treatment effect estimator is considered assuming a linearly divergent treatment effect, equidistant time-points and either a fixed number of subjects or a fixed study budget. The optimal combination of group sizes and number of repeated measures is calculated by minimizing this variance subject to a linear cost function. For a fixed number of subjects, the variance of the GLS treatment effect estimator can be decreased by adding intermediate measures per subject. This decrease is relatively large if a) the covariance structure is compound symmetric or b) the structure approaches compound symmetry and the correlation between two repeated measures does not exceed 0.80, or c) the correlation between two repeated measures does not exceed 0.60 if the time-lag goes to zero. In case the sample sizes and number of repeated measures are limited by budget constraints and the covariance structure includes a first-order auto-regression part, two repeated measures per subject yield highly efficient treatment effect estimators. Otherwise, it is more efficient to have more than two repeated measures. If the covariance structure is unknown, the optimal design based on a first-order auto-regressive structure with measurement error is preferable in terms of robustness against misspecification of the covariance structure. The numerical results are illustrated by three examples.},

  abstract = {In repeated measures studies, equidistant time-points do not always yield efficient treatment effect estimators. In the present paper, the optimal allocation of time-points is calculated for a small number of repeated measures, different covariance structures and linearly divergent treatment effects. The gain in efficiency of the treatment effect estimator by using optimally allocated time-points instead of equidistant time-points or by adding optimally spaced measures (at the expense of patients) is then computed. The assumed covariance structure is crucial for the results. For a compound symmetric covariance structure, a large gain in efficiency is obtained by adding repeated measures at the end of the study. For a first-order auto-regressive covariance structure, highly efficient treatment effect estimators are obtained with only two repeated measures, i.e. at the start and at the end of the study. For a first-order auto-regressive covariance structure including measurement error, the gain in efficiency by adding optimally spaced measures depends on the covariance parameter values. The gain in efficiency is similar with or without a random intercept. For a fixed study budget, the commonly used design with more than two equally spaced measures was never optimal for the linear cost function and covariance structures that were used.
